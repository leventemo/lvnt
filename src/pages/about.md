I think and I feel, not always being able to tell them apart. Not sure why I should. I try to be better at listening to people. And music, mostly instrumental, I don't know why. I write code and I play the Irish flute. That's six things I'm working on. I've decided to set up this digital garden. Hope to see it bear some fruit. Or veg? Or what?
