\* Tonic relative to major scale

## Modern modes built on a D major scale

| Mode       | Tonic | Interval sequence | Eg. (D major scale) |
| :--------- | :---: | :---------------: | :-----------------: |
| Ionian     |   i   |   W-W-H-W-W-W-H   |  D-E-F#-G-A-B-C#-D  |
| Dorian     |  ii   |   W-H-W-W-W-H-W   |  E-F#-G-A-B-C#-D-E  |
| Phrygian   |  iii  |   H-W-W-W-H-W-W   | F#-G-A-B-C#-D-E-F#  |
| Lydian     |  iv   |   W-W-W-H-W-W-H   |  G-A-B-C#-D-E-F#-G  |
| Mixolydian |   v   |   W-W-H-W-W-H-W   |  A-B-C#-D-E-F#-G-A  |
| Aeolian    |  vi   |   W-H-W-W-H-W-W   |  B-C#-D-E-F#-G-A-B  |
| Locrian    |  vii  |   H-W-W-H-W-W-W   | C#-D-E-F#-G-A-B-C#  |

## Modes in Irish traditional music

| Mode       | Tonic\* | Interval sequence | Eg. (D major scale) |
| :--------- | :-----: | :---------------: | :-----------------: |
| Ionian     |    i    |   W-W-H-W-W-W-H   |  D-E-F#-G-A-B-C#-D  |
| Dorian     |   ii    |   W-H-W-W-W-H-W   |  E-F#-G-A-B-C#-D-E  |
| Mixolydian |    v    |   W-W-H-W-W-H-W   |  A-B-C#-D-E-F#-G-A  |
| Aeolian    |   vi    |   W-H-W-W-H-W-W   |  B-C#-D-E-F#-G-A-B  |

A mixture of modes in tunes occurs very occasionally

- usually the first part being Mixolydian and the turn being Ionian

Beside the heptatonic scale above, pentatonic and hexatonic scales also exist

- in correspondence with the heptatonic scale, except the gaps

### Some examples

Ionian - 60% of the airs & tunes:

- Dunphy's Hornpipe
- Concertina Hornpipe

Dorian - 10% of airs & tunes:

- Elizabeth Kelly's Delight
- The Congress Reel

Mixolydian - 15% of airs & tunes:

- The Blackbird
- Hardiman the Fiddler

Aeolian - the least numerous:

- Thugamar Féin an Samradh Linn

### In practice: tunes with `#` and `##`

| Mode       | # ends on | ## ends on |
| :--------- | :-------: | :--------: |
| Ionian     |     G     |     D      |
| Dorian     |     A     |     E      |
| Mixolydian |     D     |     A      |
| Aeolian    |     E     |     B      |

An open question:

- D, A and E are common to both series
- if C doesn't occur in a tune
  - which ends in D, is it Mixolydian of # or Ionian of ##?
  - which ends in A, is it Dorian of # or Mixolydian of ##?
  - which ends in E, is it Aeolian of # or Dorian of ##?

Note:

- wouldn't a ###-series be justified in 2024?

### Accidental notes

C sharp:

- occurs usually by way of variation
- almost invariably in a weak or unaccented position
- eg.
  - `bd` replaced by a triplet of `(3bc#d`
  - `d2 de` replaced by `dc#de`
- this applies to tunes in the G series (#)
  - in tunes of the D series (##), `C` is always sharp, both in strong or weak positions

F natural

- occurs only in accented positions
- doesn't occur frequently and cannot be used at will, as a form of ornamentation
- more often found in the upper than the lower octave
- confined to tunes in the G series (#)
- one of the higly colourful notes in ITM, made by sliding upwards, with a certain amount of vibrato, from E to F sharp
  - a note of no fixed pitch but rather a long glide with a center somewhat sharper than the F natural of art music

C natural

- a highly colourful decorative note, especially on the pipes
- lies halfway between B and D
- only in tunes of the G series
