>Cycling shorts look good on humans.

Went on to Google Images to double-check my long-standing and purely aesthetic-driven aversion and I can report that no exception was found. They do not look good on humans.

Conclusion, the personal one: each to their own. Humanity can be divided into two major camps and I belong in one. I don't belong in the other.

Conclusion, the practical one: when road rage strikes in the form of a need to slow your car down because that "sportsperson" has ventured onto that narrow country road in his, say, neon-orange cycling shorts, don't yell, don't swear. Don't ask why there's no road tax for cyclists if that's true in your neck of the woods. Just observe his shorts and have a good chuckle at the sight, the incarnation of "I have the rights to ride my bike here".
