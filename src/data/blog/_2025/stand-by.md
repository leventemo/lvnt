>We will stand by ... as long as it takes.

It may sound believable on day one. Two weeks later it will mean you haven't done enough for 14 days. – Two months later ... – Two years later ...

But the sad truth is that the phrase _stand by_ couldn't be more elastic. Here are some of the meanings listed in [Oxford Learner's Dictionaries](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/stand-by?q=stand+by):
* to be present while something bad is happening but not do anything to stop it
* to be ready for action
* to help somebody or be friends with them, even in difficult situations

Clearly, it might refer to anything from "just standing there" to actually "doing something". There is a reason it's so favoured and overused by people giving press conferences.
