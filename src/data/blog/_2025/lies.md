## Table of contents

## It's in our national interest to ...

* Picked up the phrase from David Cameron, there's no need to delve into it any further, I don't think.
* However, I need to note that there seem to be so many others using the phrase as part of outright lies these days. Make your own list of them and have a look before going to vote.

## Cycling shorts look good on humans.
* Went on to Google Images to double-check my long-standing aversion and I can report that no exception was found.
* Conclusion: people are different. They can be divided into two major camps and I belong in one. I don't belong in the other.

## I'm following this religion because it provides a system of values.

* So you went around, studied the value systems of all available religions and picked the one you think will make sure your children and grandchildren benefit the most from in the future - if its values are applied to your own society now? And part of your quest was checking how the chosen religion lives up to its own values? Tell me about your informed decisions then, and the reasoning behind them.
* Or you just felt the world was burning, everything was out of place and it's easier to hold onto something steady, together with others in the same shoes?
* Or did God talk to you? I don't have words for that and it's "your job", not mine to talk about that. Why are going on about values if that's the case?
* Do you need a religion to accept and live by the basic human values? Which one(s) being the most difficult? Not killing? Not stealing? Not cheating on your spouse? Not abusing the weak? Supporting the weak?
* Have you never seen people in- or outside a religion professing "values" to others and/or their kids and doing the exact opposite in their own lives?
* Values don't fall from a tree or from the sky. They are distilled through a lifetime. Whatever values you intend to pass on to your kids today will still be tested and possibly altered tomorrow in your own life-story. And your kids are already living in their own stories working on their own value system for themselves.

## I'll do whatever is in my power to do something about it.

* Is it sufficient to offer this type of niceties and platitudes to your bank? To your boss? To your friend? To your wife or husband? To your dog? Or does it just mean "Leave me alone for now."?
* Why do then democratically, riggedly or otherwise elected leaders think they can smash it into the face of citizens?

## We will stand by ... as long as it takes.

* It may sound believable on day one. Two weeks later it will mean you haven't done enough for 14 days. - Two months later ... - Two years later ...
* Or the sad truth is that the phrase _stand by_ is as elastic as it gets? Here are some of the meanings listed in [Oxford Learner's Dictionaries](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/stand-by?q=stand+by):
  + to be present while something bad is happening but not do anything to stop it
  + to be ready for action
  + to help somebody or be friends with them, even in difficult situations
