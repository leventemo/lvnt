## It's in our national interest to ...

* Picked up the phrase from David Cameron, there's no need to delve into it any further, I don't think.
* However, I need to note that there seem to be so many others using the phrase as part of outright lies these days. Make your own list of them and have a look before going to vote.

## Cycling shorts look good on humans.

* Went on to Google Images to double-check my long-standing aversion and I can report that no exception was found.
* Conclusion: each to their own. Humanity can be divided into two major camps and I belong in one. I don't belong in the other.

## I'm following this religion because it provides a system of values.

* So I suppose you went around, studied the value systems of all available religions and picked the one you think your children and grandchildren will benefit the most from in the future - if its values are applied to your own society now. And part of your quest was checking how the chosen religion lives up to its own values, right? Tell me about your informed decisions then, and the reasoning behind them.
* Or did you just feel the world was burning, everything was out of place and it's always easier to hold onto something firm, together with others in the same shoes?
* Or did God talk to you? I don't have words for that and it's "your job", not mine to talk about it. Why are you going on about values if that's the case?
* Do you need a religion to accept and live by the basic human values? Which one(s) being the most difficult? Not killing? Not stealing? Not cheating on your spouse? Not abusing the weak? Supporting the weak?
* Have you never seen people in- or outside a religion professing "values" to others and/or their kids and doing the exact opposite in their own lives?
* Values don't fall from a tree or from the sky. They are distilled through a lifetime. Whatever values you intend to pass on to your kids today will still be tested and possibly altered tomorrow in your own life-story. And your kids are already living in their own stories working on their own value system for themselves.

## I'll do whatever is in my power to do something about it.

* Is it sufficient to offer this type of niceties and platitudes to your bank? To your boss? To your friend? To your wife or husband? To your dog? Or does it just mean "Leave me alone for now."?
* Why do then democratically, riggedly or otherwise elected leaders think they can smash it into the face of citizens without losing face?
* The careful wording makes it sound like it's full of good intentions and resolution but in most cases you were probably elected "to do whatever is in your power to do something about it" so what you are saying is simply "I'll do my job".


>“I’m very blessed in that ... I meet the average person on the street from [ages] five to 95. I meet them all and I hear their concerns. And I’d be lying if I said they’re happy right now, and somebody has to speak for the Irish people... It’s certainly not something that I’ve made any decision on, but it does get frustrating when you see the hard-working Irish taxpayer working as hard out and having no say in things."
