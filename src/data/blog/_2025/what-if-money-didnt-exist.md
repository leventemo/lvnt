This is a repost, with some added comments, of a write-up by Chris Ferdinandi.

I remember the eyebrows it raised and the meh-smile she threw at me when I put the "What if money didn't exist?" question to a friend who was reading history at uni at the time.

Here is an idea though that doesn't intend to abolish money, probably the widest abstraction that's closest to our everyday life in the most practical terms possible. It would, kind of, fine-tune or enhance the abstraction instead, wouldn't it?
