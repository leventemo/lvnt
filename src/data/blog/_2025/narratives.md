>Although climate change will have serious consequences — particularly for people in the poorest countries — it will not lead to humanity’s demise. [(Bill Gates)](https://www.gatesnotes.com/home/home-page-topic/reader/three-tough-truths-about-climate)

>Rising heat kills one person a minute worldwide, major report reveals - [the Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/oct/29/rising-heat-kills-one-person-a-minute-worldwide-lancet-countdown)
