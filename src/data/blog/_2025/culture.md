I used to hate the way English uses the word 'culture'. I thought its meaning was too broad compared to my first language, which has mainly and almost solely attributed the meaning of 'erudition' to it.

Then I realized that the meaning "what's considered a norm, the done thing" was actually an exciting thing to explore. I have no method to analise the dynamics but I find it fascinating how communities create - and are created by - ideas that everyone shares (for a while, as it all happens in time). What exactly is needed to trigger this? Is there a meaningful difference between the two directions: communities creating culture/norms and communities being created by emerging culture/norms? What are different stages of the process like? What preconditions need to be there in order for an idea to become a narrative and then to become the narrative?

As it happens, I'm far from the communities that have shaped me but that's OK for several reasons. For one thing, I don't really feel like belonging to most communities available on Earth at the moment, not to mention camps. (Yes, I'm aware, it's not necessarily a personal choice.) Secondly, it's easier to watch something from a distance. Thirdly, communities are accidental and they are always local in this: "If you delve into the local deep enough, you get to the universal."
