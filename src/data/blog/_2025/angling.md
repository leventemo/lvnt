I frown upon fishing. I think it's a form of escapism, mainly for men who need some acceptable excuse to get away from wife and kids. Funnily enough, the only reason that could take me to a lakeside with a fishing line in my hands is kids. Mine have started playing fishermen when walking or cycling to the lake nearby. I'm not looking forward to the day though.

it's not a sport, no need to explain that I suppose

fishing is doing nothing
* you really do nothing: you angle, you wait, you wait more. You are just there, that's all.
* you depend on events completely out of your control
* so it's time to find something you can do while you're there.
  + Common examples I've seen anglers do in order to kill time: drink beer, listen to the radio, stare at your phone
  + Talking to fellow anglers is definitely not the most common one: compared to listening to the radio, clearly a loser.
* if the time you spent waiting is not rewarded, no problem
  + you don't feel let down: have you ever seen a frustrated angler? You probably haven't.
  + you pack up, go home and can't wait for the next time you can come
* a good catch is clearly a source of joy but the essence of angling is not catching fish

we need time for doing nothing
