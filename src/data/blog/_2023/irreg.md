Irreg is a filterable list of English irregular verbs. Filtering is done by CEFR levels. Items are clickable: users can listen to the three forms of the verbs pronounced and they can open a modal window with translations and links to entries of reputed dictionaries. Built with HTML and JavaScript, using the [Web Speech API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Speech_API). The styling was inspired by one single button I liked a lot.
