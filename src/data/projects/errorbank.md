description: "A database of errors made by Spanish speakers when using English."
---

Work on this one is still in progress. It looks into how L1 interference comes into play in the case of Spanish learners of English, building up statistical data of different error types across different CEFR levels.

The blog posts below detail some aspects of it:

For a tester, here is a merely statistical but real-time overview of the state of the database as it's being fed with data. The info is pulled directly from the database itself so when I update it on its platform, numbers here get updated as well.

| CEFR levels |   courses   |  errors  | learners | assignments |
| :---------: | :---------- | :------- | :------- | :---------- |
| A1          | no data     | 0        | 0        | 0           |
| A2          | no data     | 0        | 0        | 0           |
| B1          | PET1        | 1        | 1        | 1           |
